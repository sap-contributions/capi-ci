# capi-ci

Hello, this is the CAPI team's CI repo. It houses Concourse configuration settings for our CI environments.

Check it out! https://concourse.app-runtime-interfaces.ci.cloudfoundry.org/teams/capi-team/pipelines/capi

:pushpin: This repository has gone through a complete overhaul. The old artifacts can still be found on the [legacy branch](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-ci/tree/legacy).

## Environments

See [pipeline.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-ci/blob/main/ci/pipeline.yml) for more details.

### What's Up with Kiki

Kiki starts with an older version of cf-deployment. It then runs the new migrations, but keeps the old Cloud Controller code. This catches any backwards-incompatible migrations. This is important because Cloud Controller instances do rolling upgrades. For example: if you write a migration that drops a table, old CC instances that depend on that table existing will crash during the rolling deploy.

## Pipelines

### capi

This pipeline is responsible for testing, building, and releasing capi-release. For guidance on releasing CAPI, see [this document](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/blob/develop/docs/releasing-capi.md).

#### capi-release

This is where the majority of testing for capi-release components live.

- Runs unit tests for Cloud Controller and bridge components
- Builds capi-release release candidates and deploys to Elsa, Kiki, Asha, Olaf, and Scar
- Runs appropriate integration tests for each environment
- Bumps the `ci-passed` branch of capi-release
- Updates release candidate in v3 docs every time `ci-passed` branch is updated.

#### bump-dependencies

Automatically bumps golang version for capi-release components every time a new [golang-release](https://github.com/bosh-packages/golang-release) is available. Also bumps Redis.

#### ship-it

Jobs responsible for cutting a capi-release.

- Bump API versions
- Update API docs
- Release capi-release

#### bbl-up

Updates the bosh deployments for all the pipeline environments (using `bbl up`).

#### bbl-destroy

Theoretically useful for destroying broken bosh deployments for all the pipeline environments. Often doesn't work because the directors are in such bad state. There are also jobs to manually release pool resources for the following environments: Elsa, Asha, and Scar.

### bosh-lites

Pipeline responsible for managing the development [bosh-lite pool](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-env-pool/).

- Create new bosh-lites if there is room in the pool
- Delete released bosh-lites

#### Using Pooled Environments

There are a number of helpful scripts in [capi-workspace](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-workspace) for using the bosh-lite pool. Most notably, `claim_bosh_lite`, `unclaim_bosh_lite`, and `print_env_info`. See [the commands list](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-workspace#capi-commands) for a full list of useful commands for interacting with the pool.
